#History
Trinnorica 2.0 development has been completely and utterly stopped. For any of you who follow my updates you would know that I started Trinnorica alone, but under the name 'Upsilon'. Soon after I started working with a new developer 'Joseph Phillips', and renamed the project to 'Trinnorica' for it's first release. Joseph (Joey) and I created the game for and FBLA competition called 'Computer Game and Simulation Programming' and we took it all the way to the FBLA National Leadership Conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Soon after I started development on Trinnorica 2.0, but I have halted production because I have reentered the competition under the same topic, and I want to use 'Trinnorica 2.0', but I can't because I submitted it last year. Because of this I am renaming Trinnorica and continuing development with a new partner.

#Future
The new version will be named differently but it will have everything I mentioned in the [Trinnorica 2.0 Announcement](http://quickscythe.github.io/blog/2016/08/04/trinnorica-2-announcement/) post I made back in August. I will keep with the theme of changing the name of the game for every major update. However it won't be a legit name change, after this update the name will always be Trinnorica, but the 'Code Name' will be different.

#Present
Right now we don't have a name for the new version of Trinnorica, but we will be sure to post when we come up with it, on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Quick_Scythe).
