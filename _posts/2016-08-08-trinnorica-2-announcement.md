#Trinnorica 2.0 development has officially started!

If you follow my activities, you would know that I created a game entitled Trinnorica with my friend and FBLA partner, Joseph Phillips, and took it to the 2016 National Leadership Conference for FBLA in Atlanta, GA, and it is time to expand on that game, and make it better than ever!

##Changes

```
- New images and avatars
- Different levels
- Faster gameplay
- Better sounds
- New sponsors
- And against my better judgement, but suggested by many: <i>Better</i> clouds!</li>
```
