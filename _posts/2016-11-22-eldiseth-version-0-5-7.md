#Trinnorica 2.0 development has officially started!

I want to start this post off my saying I'm sorry it's been so long since I have posted! That being said let's talk about updates. As I mentioned before, I have renamed Trinnorica, however it will still be called Trinnorica, each name it has being more of a 'Code name' for it's versions. That being said this version's code name is 'Eldiseth'. Below is a screenshot of what it is looking like as of this moment. Further down the line we will have many more features, but enjoy this little screenshot. :-)
